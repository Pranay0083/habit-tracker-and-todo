# Case Study: All-in-One Productivity App for Task and Habit Management

# Why I'm Building This Productivity App

## My Motivation

I've always struggled to find a single tool that helps me manage both my daily habits and my bigger projects in one place. Most apps either focus on to-dos or habit tracking, but rarely bothâ€”and almost never in a way that feels truly integrated or motivating. I wanted something that could help me see the big picture and the small steps, keep me accountable, and give me real insights into my progress.

## What This App Helps With

This app is my attempt to solve my own productivity challenges:

- **Stay on Track:** I can see my daily tasks and habits together, so nothing slips through the cracks.
- **Break Down Big Goals:** I can break large projects into smaller, manageable steps, and actually see my progress as I complete sub-tasks.
- **Build Consistency:** Tracking habits alongside tasks helps me build routines and stay consistent over time.
- **Get Real Insights:** Visual summaries and analytics help me understand when I'm most productive and what I tend to procrastinate on.

## What the App Includes

### Daily View
- My home screen for the day: shows today's habits, to-dos, and a quick progress summary (like "3/5 habits complete").

### To-Dos
- A project management hub where I can create tasks, break them into unlimited sub-tasks, set due dates and priorities, and add notes. Parent tasks show progress bars that update as I finish sub-tasks.

### Habits
- A dedicated section for all my habits, with streaks, micro-graphs for recent history, and detailed stats like best streak, completion rate, and average frequency. I can easily add new habits, set how often I want to do them, and add reminders.

### Data & Insights
- The app generates graphs for daily/weekly completion rates and project progress. It also gives me actionable insights, like highlighting my most productive days and showing which tasks I tend to put off.

This project is a personal journey to build the productivity system I've always wanted. If it helps others too, that's even better!
